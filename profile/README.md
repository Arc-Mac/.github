## What is Arc Browser for Mac?

Arc Browser for Mac is a next-generation web browser designed to transform how you interact with the internet. It replaces the traditional top-tab layout with a sleek sidebar and introduces Spaces—separate workspaces for different projects or contexts. This allows users to keep their workflow organized without clutter.

Built specifically for macOS, Arc takes full advantage of the system’s performance and aesthetics. It includes features like Peek (quick previews of links), Boosts (custom CSS and JS injections), and Easels (collaborative whiteboards). The browser also supports vertical tabs, pinned tabs, and automatic tab archiving to keep your workspace clean.

Whether you’re a developer, designer, writer, or student, Arc Browser Mac helps you browse smarter and faster. It’s free to use and regularly updated with new functionality tailored for creative and productive workflows.
